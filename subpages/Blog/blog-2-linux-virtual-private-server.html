        Earlier these holidays, I bought a virtual private server (VPS) from IONOS. This
        is effectively a computer in the cloud, but technically a portion of server 
        resources that is virtualised to simulate an individual computer. I chose the 
        Linux S plan which grants me a 2 vCore Processor (probably 2 threads of a CPU 
        core from an Intel Xeon CPU), 2GB Memory, 80GB NVMe Storage. This costs about 
        Â£4/month, and a setup fee, but has an offer to be discounted for the first few
        months. It also features unlimited traffic with 1GB/second bandwidth, root 
        access, and Plesk web host software.
      </p>

        I didn't quite know if I should get one or not, but I thought it would be fun to 
        own one. With it, I could host my own website, or run types of scripts, back up
        important media, or install software in an isolated, remote environment where I 
        wouldn't ruin any operation of my home network or computer. Also, I wouldn't be 
        paying directly for electricity costs which is a plus. I'm also learning a bit of
        Linux as well to get more familiar with other operating systems than Windows. 
        Speaking of operating system, I had initially installed Debian 12 Server, because 
        I was messing around with a Raspberry Pi which is running Raspbian - a Linux distribution
        based on Debian. I found it tough to use as a beginner so I then looked searched around for
        alternatives and apparently Ubuntu was more user-friendly as it has better software 
        compatibility ans software support from the jump. So, I installed Ubuntu Server 22.04 and 
        it seemed to run fine.

        Around this time (June) I wanted to get a Raspberry Pi enviro sensor and have this display on some
        sort of Grafana dashboard or live data on a website which I could host on my VPS. Unfortunately, 
        I think it was too complicated for me at this time - because it needed knowledge on MQTT, Node-Red, 
        InfluxDB, and Grafana, but there was another method using Prometheus and Docker. Anyways I had just 
        been confusing myself but knew there were other things I could set up instead right now. I was reading an article
